They want to be close to public transit, nearby parks, and affordable restaurants. They would also like the adjacent neighborhoods to be desirable as well, as long as they are in walking distance (up to 1 mile).\n\n### Business Problem\nCan we build a model to recommend a neighborhood to live in, based on their specified criteria?\n",
